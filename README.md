# Image-Processing-c
class projects for cs712 image processing

The "ReadWriteResizePGM.c" is a c file that can resize a pgm file.
Currently the resize factor "ratio" can only be int.
For enlarge, set ratio in line 56 to positive integer;
for reduction, set ratio in line 56 to negative integer.
(for example, ratio=-2 means it will be resized to 1/2)
There are two pgm files called 0.5xresize.pgm and 2xresize.pgm in 
the folder that are created using this c file and test-image.pgm.
